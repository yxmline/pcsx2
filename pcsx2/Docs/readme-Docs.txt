    /pcsx2/Docs/ Folder
---------------------------

This folder contains original "editable format" documents that are packaged with releases.
Changes and updates should be made to these files and then exported to PDF format into the
/bin/docs/ folder prior to running installers or packaging zip files.

Also contained in this folder for now are GPL license and header files.
These are not needed for building public releases.

The legacy/ folder contains changelogs and blogs for the CVS development branch of PCSX2
(being 0.9.4 and prior releases).

IMPORTANT: Documents saved here must be of a format that everyone (or mostly everyone) can
read! This seems to exclude Word 2007 and ODT (openoffice) formats; the latter because Word
likes to save non-standard ODT files that OpenOffice can't read correctly (Whoops).  So far the
*best* choice seems to be the Word 97/2000 format.  It's fairly feature-full, and seems to be
well-supported by most word processors these days (most importantly Word and OpenO).

When editing and re-saving doc files, please make sure that you have enabled legacy
Word 97/2000 output.
Word and OpenOffice should be set by default to retain the format, but may prompt you
to upgrade to a newer version.  IGNORE IT.
